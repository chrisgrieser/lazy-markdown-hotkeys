A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) providing hotkeys that select words and lines in a smart way[^4] before applying markup. Multiple cursors are supported as well.

---

> __Note__  
> Most of the plugin's commands have been added to Obsidian core by now. This plugin is therefore not in active development anymore.

## Markup Commands with Smart Expansion

- Smarter Bold
- Smarter Italics
- Smarter Underscore Bold (`__foobar__`)
- Smarter Underscore Italics (`_foobar_`)
- Smarter Comment\*
- Smarter HTML Comment\*
- Smarter Inline/Fenced Code\*
- Smarter Highlight
- Smarter Bold & Highlight[^3]
- Smarter Italics & Highlight[^3]
- Smarter Strikethrough
- Smarter Markdown/Image Link
- Smarter Wikilink (Internal Link)
- Smarter Wikilink with Heading
- Smarter Mathjax\*
- Smarter Callout Label

All commands also support __multiple cursors__, smart __inclusion/exclusion of special characters__, and __undoing markup__ by triggering the same hotkey.

<small>\* These commands _wrap whole blocks_ instead of wrapping each line when the hotkey is triggered on a multi-line selection. They also switch to the appropriate syntax, for example from inline code syntax to fenced code syntax. (See below for details.)</small>

### Command-Specific Details

The following commands have some special features:

#### Smarter Markdown/Image Link

- __Auto-Insert URLs__: When you use `Smarter Markdown Link` and have an URL in your clipboard, the URL will automatically get inserted as well.
- __Automatic Switch to Image Syntax__ When the URL in the clipboard ends with an image extension like `.png`,[^2] the command will also prepend the `!` for image links.

#### Smarter Inline/Fenced Code

- __Terms instead of Words:__ `Smarter Code` will _not_ consider punctuation or brackets as delimiters. This means that a cursor anywhere in "object.method" will select the whole term and result correctly in "`object.method`" instead of "`object`.method". (Similar to WORD in Vim.)
- __Automatic Switch to Fenced Code Syntax__: When more than one line is selected, `Smarter Code` will wrap the selected lines in [fenced code syntax](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Code+blocks) instead. Furthermore, the cursor is moved to the beginning of the fenced code block so you can conveniently enter the code language.
- 💡 `Smarter Fenced Code` synergizes well with the [Codeblock Completer Plugin](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/codeblock-completer).

#### Smarter Comment

- __Automatic Switch to Block Comments__: When more than one line is selected, the `Smarter Comment` commands will expand the selection to whole blocks and then [wrap all of them together](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Comments) into the comment syntax.

#### Smarter Wikilink

- __Auto-Suggest__: When turning text into a wikilink, `Smarter Wikilinks` will trigger the suggester afterwards.
- __Wikilink a Heading__: Alternative command that inserts the syntax for a markdown link to a heading, and also triggers the Suggester after doing so. (i.e., instead of `[[ ]]`, it uses `[[## ]]`).

#### Smarter Mathjax

- __Automatic Switch to Blocks__: When more than one line is selected, the `Smarter MathJax` command will also [expand the selection to whole blocks](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#Math) and switch from `$` to `$$`. (I do not use Mathjax myself, so feel free to open an issue when the Mathjax command can be improved somehow.)

#### Smarter Callout Label

Turns the text under the cursor into a callout _label_.

## Non-Markup Commands with Smart Expansion Logic

### Smarter Punctuation Commands

While strictly speaking quotation marks and brackets are not a form of markup, I found it quite useful to be able to set them in the same way. Therefore, the following commands have been added as well.

- Smarter Quotation Marks
- Smarter Round Brackets
- Smarter Square Brackets
- Smarter Curly Brackets

When there is no selection, the the Smarter Punctuation Commands essentially emulate `ysiw"`, `ysiw)`, `ysiw]`, and `ysiw}` from [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround).

### Smarter Case Switching

The same logic can also be applied to case switching commands. First, the selection is expanded to whole words. Then, the casing of the whole selection is changed. Instead of having multiple hotkeys for each type of casing, this command smartly switches the case depending on the current state.

- `lower case` → `Sentence case`\*
- `Sentence case`\* → `UPPER CASE`
- `UPPER CASE` → `lower case`
- `OTheR` → `Sentence case`

This allows you to repeatedly press the hotkey to achieve a certain result, e.g. two times on a `lowercase` word to make it `UPPERCASE`.

<small>\* `Sentence case` means that the first letter of the string will be capitalized, like in an English sentence. If the string only contains one word, `Sentence case` produces the same result as `Capital Case`.</small>

### Smarter Delete Text

Deletes text with the same text-expanding logic from the smarter markdown commands. (This command is similar to `daw` in Vim.)

## Commands without Smart Expansion

These commands have simply been added for convenience. They do not use any kind of selection expansion, but are still attempts to improve the normal commands they correspond to.

### Smarter Toggle Heading

Increases the Heading Level of the line under the cursor by 1. If already at 6, removes the heading instead. Intended for pressing it quickly multiple times, e.g. pressing the hotkey 3 times to turn a normal line into a h3.

<img width=60% alt="Demo Smarter Toggle Heading Command" src="demo/smarter-toggle-heading.gif">

### Smarter Insert New Line

Inserts line break, even when the cursor is in a nested list. Pressing `return` in a nested list normally inserts a line break followed by a indented list marker. (This command is essentially the same as `o` in Vim.)

### Smarter Delete Current Note (deprecated)

Deletes the current note, but also goes back to the last file instead of leaving an empty pane. (This requires `Confirm File Deletion` in the Obsidian settings to be _disabled_.)

*Deprecated. With recent versions of Obsidian, deleting a file does not result in empty panes, so this command is now basically obsolete. The command is only left in the plugin to ensure people's hotkeys do not break.*

### Smarter Copy Path

Press once to copy the vault-relative path of the current file, press a second time to copy the absolute path. Press a third time to copy the (vault-relative) path to the parent folder.

### Smarter Copy File Name

Press once to copy the name of the current file without extension, press a second time to copy it with extension.

### Toggle Readable Line Length & Toggle Line Numbers

These do pretty much what the name says.

## How the Smart Expansion works in detail

`Inline code` signifies the part of the text being selected. `|` is a cursor without selection. This table serves as a reference for the precise mechanics of this plugin.

You can take a look which characters exactly are included or excluded by taking a look at the [`const.ts`](const.ts#L144).

## Setting the Hotkeys

If you want to replace the default commands from Obsidian, remember to remove their hotkey binding before changing the hotkeys from this plugin. Example for `Smarter Bold`:

1. Remove the hotkey `cmd/ctrl + B`[^1] for the default command `Toggle Bold`.
2. Assign `cmd/ctrl + B` as the hotkey for the command `Smarter Bold`.

💡 For the Smarter Punctuation Commands, you can also use a hotkey with `shift`, e.g. `shift + 2` for Smarter Quotation Marks. Curiously, Obsidian accepts such hotkeys, so you can basically "overwrite" normal punctuation typing if you want to.

However, note that this comes at the cost of losing the ability to type punctuation normally. Also, this does seem to result in minor bugs, e.g. [interference with Obsidian's in-document search](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-smarter-md-hotkeys/issues/23).

## Installation

The plugin is available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Browse` → Search for _"Smarter Markdown Hotkeys"_

## Contribute

The easiest way to make contributions is to make changes to `const.st`, since the constants there determine commands and what to include/exclude.

Please use the `.eslintrc` configuration located in the repository and run eslint before doing a pull request, and do _not_ use `prettier`. 🙂

```shell
# Run eslint fixing most common mistakes
eslint --fix *.ts
```

[^1]: macOS uses `cmd`, Windows and Linux use `ctrl`.
[^2]: The supported image extensions are [listed here](const.ts#L156).
[^3]: These commands are mostly used for Multi-Color Highlights that some Obsidian themes like [Sanctum](https://github.com/jdanielmourao/obsidian-sanctum) or [Shimmering Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus) offer.
[^4]: When there is no selection, the smart expansion is essentially equivalent to `ysiw{markup}` from [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround), but with less keystrokes.
